Commit messages should look like [this](https://github.com/vgmoose/movement/commit/18f69fa65d63d5dea0bb84aaff5b0de606547304). 

More specifically:

1. The first line should be lowercase and a single statement on its own enough to summarize the commit. No period.
2. All successive lines should start with a capital letter and end with a period. Newlines can separate new ideas. This should be as long as required to fully summarize every detail of the commit contents.
3. The textwidth should not exceed 72 characters. This can be set in vim with ``:set tw=72``.
4. All commit messages can be signed. This can be done with ``git commit -s`` or if the commit is already made, ``git commit -s --amend``.
